## 105-Unit-3

This is a repository containing instructional materials and sample datasets for Professor Gotzler's English 105 class at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

This repository is intended for newer users.
The purpose of this repository is to help newer users navigate Jupyter Lab and creating subsidized data.
This repository has the potential to be a starting point for users who want to learn how to navigate data compilation.

The repository contains:
- A starter notebook explaining how to use Jupyter Lab (labeled new-workspace.jupyterlab-workspace)
- 3 notebooks explaining how to use Python and pandas (labeled Python Basics.ipynb, Using Pandas1.ipynb, and Using Pandas2.ipynb)
- The raw dataset being used for examples (labeled CountyHealthData_2014-2015)
- An instructional file (teaching users how to upload their chosen dataset, create a subset of the data, and export it (labeled Data Compilation)
- The new subset created through the instructional file (labeled RI_subset)
- A visual example of the subsidized information (labeled RI-subset Data Visualization)


## Data Usage and Replication

The raw data used throughout this repository came through the County Health Public Database provided to use by Professor Gotzler. The subset of data and data visualizations created from the raw data were created in order to provide a simplified set of data focused on two singular subjects; The Physical Health Days vs Mental Health Days experienced by North Carolina Counties in 2015. Instructions for replicating the subset can be found in the steps laid out in Data Compilation, a file linked in the repository files. 


##Analysis

In order to process the data in a more simplified, easier-to-read way, a visualization of the data was created based on the newly formed subset of County Health Public Data. The following visualizations show a visual example of Physical Health Days vs Mental Health Days taken in various counties in North Carolina in 2015.
